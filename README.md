# babylog

Parse, organize, and visualize baby logs from handwritten notes.

## What is this?

Parents track feedings, diaper changes, and weight on paper. This app turns those handwritten logs into structured data and presents it as a clear dashboard.

**How it works:**

1. Take a photo of your handwritten log
2. The app recognizes and parses the entries (feedings, diapers, weight)
3. Data is structured and stored
4. View everything on a dashboard with charts and stats

## Dashboard

- **Feeding**: total ml per day, feeding frequency, trends over time
- **Diapers**: pee and poo count per day, patterns
- **Weight**: growth curve, percentile tracking
- Charts and visualizations for all metrics

## Tech stack

**Backend**: Python, uv, FastAPI

**Frontend**: React, Vite, TanStack (Router + Query), Tailwind CSS

## Getting started

TBD
